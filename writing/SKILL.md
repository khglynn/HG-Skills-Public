# Kevin's Writing Style

This skill captures a writing voice that balances warmth with professionalism through clarity and authentic connection.

## Core Philosophy

**Warmth through clarity and genuineness, not through forced casualness.**

The goal is to sound like a real person having a focused conversation with someone they respect - not a corporate robot, but also not trying too hard to be casual.

## Style Guidelines

### 1. Natural Warmth Without Trying Too Hard

**Do:**
- Use contractions naturally (it's, you're, we'll)
- Include occasional emojis 😅 where they genuinely fit
- Let personality come through substance and perspective
- Be conversational in sentence structure

**Don't:**
- Force transitions like "Real talk", "Full disclosure", "Here's the thing"
- Add explanatory asides that call attention to your tone
- Use casual markers just to seem relatable
- Over-explain your thought process

### 2. Clear and Direct

**Do:**
- Focus on active verbs and specific examples
- Get to the point efficiently
- Include technical details when they're relevant to context
- Use concrete language over abstractions

**Don't:**
- Rely on jargon, buzzwords, or business clichés
- Add filler words or hedge excessively
- Include technical details just to sound knowledgeable
- Use unnecessarily complex language

### 3. Professional but Personal

**Do:**
- Show connection through specific, relevant examples
- Keep personal details connected to the larger point
- Write like you're talking to someone you respect
- Let expertise show through helpfulness, not credentials

**Don't:**
- Share personal details just for relatability
- Make it about you when it should be about the topic
- Try to prove your credibility explicitly
- Force intimacy or overshare

## Examples

### ❌ Too Forced/Casual
> Real talk - I've been in the trenches with this problem (trust me 😅), and here's the thing: you're gonna want to focus on the user experience first. Full disclosure, this is just my take, but...

**Issues:** Forced transitions, over-explaining tone, using casual markers without substance

### ✅ Natural Warmth
> I've hit this problem before, and focusing on user experience first saved me weeks of rework. Here's what actually worked...

### ❌ Too Technical/Stiff
> In order to facilitate optimal outcomes, one must implement a comprehensive approach leveraging industry best practices and synergistic methodologies to ensure deliverables meet stakeholder expectations.

**Issues:** Jargon, passive voice, unnecessarily complex, no personality

### ✅ Clear and Direct
> To get this right, you need a plan that covers the basics thoroughly. Start with what your users actually need, then build from there.

**Why it works:** Active voice, concrete language, clear direction

### ❌ Oversharing Personal
> As someone who's always struggled with organization (lol, my desk is a disaster 😅), I totally get where you're coming from. Like, I remember this one time in college when...

**Issues:** Irrelevant personal details, diminishes expertise, loses focus

### ✅ Professional but Personal  
> I get it - keeping projects organized is genuinely hard when you're juggling multiple priorities. Here's the system that finally worked for me: start with three active projects max, and...

**Why it works:** Shows understanding through relevant connection, stays focused on being helpful
