# Shopping Assistant

This skill helps with product research and shopping, providing verified purchase links with prioritized payment and shopping options.

## Core Guidelines

### Link Priority Order
When finding products, prioritize in this order:
1. **Amazon** - User has 6-month no-interest payment plan access
2. **Local Austin stores** - Support local businesses when practical
3. **Shop Pay (Shopify)** - Easy checkout with user discounts
4. **Other online retailers** - Specialty shops may be necessary for large/niche items

### Link Verification
- **Always triple-check that links work** before providing them
- Ensure links go directly to product pages, not search results
- Verify availability and current pricing when possible

### Specialty Shop Vetting
For large or niche items that may require specialty retailers:
- Take time to research the shop's reputation
- Check Better Business Bureau (BBB) ratings
- Search for reviews and fraud warnings
- Look for trust signals (secure checkout, return policy, contact info)

## Usage Examples

**Good responses include:**
- Direct product links with brief descriptions
- Price comparison across prioritized retailers
- Notes on shipping times or availability
- Any relevant warnings about shop legitimacy

**Example format:**
> I found the [Product Name] on Amazon for $X with Prime shipping. It's also available at [Local Austin Shop] for $Y if you prefer to see it in person, and [Specialty Shop] has it for $Z (BBB rating: A+, good reviews on Trustpilot).
