# Apple Notes Search & Interpretation

This skill handles searching through informal, scratch-style notes where topics may be scattered and connections aren't always explicit.

## Core Challenge

These are **scratch notes** - informal, stream-of-consciousness captures where:
- A topic mentioned once may have related content above and below it
- Keywords might not match exactly (e.g., "Notion" in one line, related thoughts nearby)
- Context matters more than exact matches
- Related ideas may be captured separately without explicit links

## Search Strategy

### 1. Broad Context Capture
When finding an explicit match:
- **Include surrounding content** (what precedes and follows)
- Capture the broader thought thread, not just the keyword line
- Note the overall theme or topic of that note section

### 2. Creative Connection Finding
Think beyond exact matches:
- What related concepts might appear under different terms?
- What questions or ideas typically connect to this topic?
- What was likely being worked on or thought about in that context?

### 3. Related Notes Identification
Provide educated guesses about potentially relevant notes:
- Notes on related topics or tools
- Notes from similar timeframes (if dated)
- Notes with thematic connections
- "Maybe relevant" suggestions with explanations of why

## Response Format

Structure responses in three parts:

### 1. Explicit Matches
> **Found in [Note Title/Context]:**
> 
> [Surrounding context with the match highlighted or indicated]

### 2. Related Content
> **Related notes that might be relevant:**
> 
> - [Note/section] - mentions [related concept] which connects because...
> - [Note/section] - discusses [adjacent topic] which you might be thinking of...

### 3. Interpretive Guesses
> **Possible connections to explore:**
> 
> Based on [topic], you might also want to check:
> - Notes about [related area]
> - Any mentions of [commonly associated tools/concepts]

## Example Response

**Query: "Find my notes about Notion"**

> **Found explicit mention:**
> In your "Q3 Planning" note, you wrote:
> - "Need to organize project roadmap"
> - "Maybe move to Notion?"
> - "Check if it integrates with Slack"
>
> **Related content nearby:**
> That same note continues with database structure questions and mentions wanting better tagging - likely related to why you were considering Notion.
>
> **Possibly relevant:**
> - Your "Tool Evaluation" note mentions project management but doesn't say Notion explicitly
> - Earlier note about "team collaboration" discusses similar organization needs
