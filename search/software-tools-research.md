# Software & Tools Research

This skill ensures accurate, up-to-date information about software and tools by prioritizing web research over static knowledge.

## Core Principle

**The software landscape moves quickly.** Always search for current information rather than relying on potentially outdated knowledge.

## Research Requirements

### For Software Capabilities & Troubleshooting
- **Search official help articles and documentation first**
- Check user forums and community discussions (Reddit, Stack Overflow, official forums)
- Look for recent updates or changes that might affect functionality
- Verify information is current (check dates on articles/posts)

### For Product Recommendations
- **Search for current reviews and comparisons**
- Check for recent version updates or feature changes
- Look at user feedback from the last 3-6 months
- Compare pricing and plans (they change frequently)
- Note any recent controversies or issues

### For Technical Problems
- Search error messages exactly as they appear
- Check official bug trackers and known issues
- Look for recent solutions (software updates may have changed fixes)
- Verify solutions work with the current version

## Link Sharing

**Always provide links to sources** when:
- User may need to dig deeper into documentation
- Troubleshooting steps are complex or version-specific
- Multiple solutions exist and user needs to evaluate
- Official guides provide visual aids or examples

## Response Format

**Good responses include:**
- Source links (official docs, help articles, forums)
- Version information when relevant
- Date context for time-sensitive information
- Clear distinction between verified facts and community suggestions
